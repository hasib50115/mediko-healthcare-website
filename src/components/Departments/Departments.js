                        <h3>DENTAL</h3>
                        <p>Regular teeth cleaning by a dentist removes plaque that may develop, even with careful brushing and flossing. This is very important for getting at areas that are hard to reach on your own. Professional cleaning includes scaling and polishing. This procedure uses instruments to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth. Routine exams may include dental x-rays. Your dentist can catch problems early, so they do not become more serious and expensive to fix.</p>

                        <h3>COSMETIC</h3>
                        <p>During the cyst removal, the high heat CO2 laser will melt down the inner content of the cyst. Complete removal of the entire cyst wall is the best way to ensure the sebaceous cysts do not return; hence laser treatments often work best especially for sensitive areas of the skin, such as the face. Generally, once removed, the skin can heal by itself.</p>

                        <h3>PHYSICIANS</h3>
                        <p>A physician is a medical doctor who usually focuses on the non-surgical treatment of patientsâ€™ conditions. That is not to say that being a physician is not practical; most specialisms have a unique range of procedures that relate to their specialty. It is common to work in the hospital setting, working in teams of varying sizes.</p>
